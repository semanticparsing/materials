  - Notes
    - Progmatics
      - Semantics: what does it mean **literally**?
      - Progmatics: what is the speaker really conveying?
        * Underlying principle (Grice, 1975): language is a cooperative game between speaker and listener.
        * Implicatures and presuppositions depand on people and context and involves soft inference.
    - Distributional semantics
      - distributional hypothesis: semantically similar words occur in similar contexts [Harris, 1954].
      - "You shall know a word by the company it keeps." [Firth, 1957]
    - Frame semantics: meaning given by a frame, a stereotypical situation
