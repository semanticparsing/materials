## 自然语言抗噪性质
Human natural language processing (NLP) is robust against noise in the sense that small perturbations of the input do not affect processing
negatively. Such perturbations -- including letter insertions, deletions, substitutions and transpositions and the insertion of spaces
("guacamole'' or "gua camole") and the deletion of spaces ("ran fast'' or "ranfast'') -- often cause token-based processing to fail.
Character-level models may be better equipped do deal with this noise. *from [here](https://sites.google.com/view/sclem2017/description-ideas)*

## Parts-of-Speech定义
“linguists group some words of language into classes (sets) which show similar syntactic behaviour.”
